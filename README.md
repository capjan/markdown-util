Markdown Utils

# Features

- Linting - to satisfy my demand for correctness
- Automatic Linking
- [Documentation](./Docs/README.md)

# Motivation

I made the decision to switch privately from Confluence to Markdown for my own
documentation. This move had pros and cons for me, but that's another topic.

I created this command line tool to fix some of the disadvantages that annoy
me and make my work with Markdown easier and more secure.
