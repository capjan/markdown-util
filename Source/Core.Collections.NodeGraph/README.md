# Core Node Graph

`Node Graph` implements as the name suggests a simple graph data structure.

## Structure

- Node Graph is a `general tree` graph structure, because we have no restrictions
in the hierarchy.
- A Node can have as many children (siblings) as needed.


## Features

- Every node in the graph has an optional parent and 0-n child nodes
- Visitors can traversal the graph `deep` or `bread` first
- Based on interfaces that makes it easy to add it to existing classes
