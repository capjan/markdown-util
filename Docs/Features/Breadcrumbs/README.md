# Breadcrumbs

[Dokumentation](../../README.md) • [Features](../README.md) • Breadcrumbs

## Goals

- Adding an easy navigation on top of every page
- Helps reordering the documentation
- This command must be executed in the root folder of the project!

### Command
```bash
mdu abn
```

Or longer and better readable:

```bash
mdu add-breadcrumb-navigation
```
