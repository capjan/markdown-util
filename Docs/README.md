Dokumentation

## Inspiration

- This tool is for people writing documentation in Markdown files (hopefully in a git repository)
- No vendor lock in. Your documentation is yours and consists of a collection of ordinary Markdown files
- This Tool helps you to reorder your files by adding a breadcrumb navigation
- This tool is a static code generator that can render your documentation to HTML
- Open Source on GitHub (See [Project](https://github.com/capjan/markdown-util))
